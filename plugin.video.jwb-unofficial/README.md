Unofficial JW Broadcasting plugin for Kodi
==========================================

*This is a fork/continuation of the "JW Broadcasting (unofficial)" add-on, as the previous author decided to take it down. I've tried to address some of his concerns.*

### This is not an official app

Please use the official [JW Broadcasting App](https://www.jw.org/en/online-help/jw-broadcasting/) if available on your device.

Even consider buying a device that supports the official app. You'll get get best support and experience that way.

This add-on is not officially supported by the Watchtower Society. Do not contact jw.org for support of any kind. If you feel the need for technical support, please leave an issue here on GitHub.

### The risks

Please read [w18 April page 30-31](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2018364) first.

You have to decide if you want to take these risks:

* Changes made to improve tv.jw.org may break this add-on.
* You may not get the full benefit from tv.jw.org by using this add-on.
* You are trusting a third-party to deliver spiritual food to you.
* This repo _could_ get hacked, you know.

### Installation
With all these things in mind, this add-on is intended for you technically minded folks, who can make that decision. For the time being I won't upload it to the main Kodi repository, so you won't receive updates automatically.

#### Install from zip file
This is the easiest way to install the plugin.

1. Download the [ZIP](https://github.com/allejok96/plugin.video.jwb-unofficial/archive/master.zip) and put it on your Kodi device
1. In Kodi: click on "Add-ons"
1. Click on the little box icon in the upper left hand corner
1. "Install from zip file"
1. Browse to the directory with the zip and select it

#### Install from git repo
This way makes updating easier.

In the example we choose store the git repo in your home directory. On Linux:

1. Go to your home dir `cd ~`
1. Download the repo `git clone https://github.com/allejok96/plugin.video.jwb-unofficial`
1. Create a symlink to it in the Kodi add-on directory `ln -s ~/plugin.video.jwb-unofficial ~/.kodi/addons/`
1. In Kodi: go to Add-ons > My add-ons > Video add-ons > JWB unofficial and Enable it

*And lastly a huge thanks to the original author of this add-on, who whishes to stay anonymous.*
